# Intrinsic Flowstate project

This template contains basic setup for Intrinsic Flowstate project.
It provides configuration for a dev container, which Flowstate development
experience is centered around. For more information about developing
with Flowstate visit [Intrinsic documentation](https://developers.intrinsic.ai/)
website.

We strive to provide comprehensive environment with our dev container
setup. If you find yourself in a need of additional tooling, the easiest
way to add more tooling is to add extra features to dev container
definition. To find a list of available third party features please
see [official list](https://containers.dev/features) of available features.
